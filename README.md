MINI PROJECT:
Ecommerce data Loading System

In an E-Commerce Site,

Each product is a XML file - we have 100 such files. Using multi threading, perform following operation

Efficient file reading had to be there

Data consistency has to be ensured: all files may not have entire data, system should detect it

Reporting Mechanism: Details


Exact Requirements:

1. There are 100 Product XML files present in local Storage.
2. Read 2-3 fields from each file and load all data to destination file
3. As soon as file loads, the status should pop up saying that this file has been loaded.
4. If required fields are not present, need to show that file and should no load it to the Destination file
	Use multi threading to achieve the same
